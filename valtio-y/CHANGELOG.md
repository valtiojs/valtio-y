# valtio-y

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bbcc527: Fix `trackedOrigins: undefined` handling in UndoManager. Previously, explicitly passing `trackedOrigins: undefined` was incorrectly replaced with the default Set. Now properly preserves `undefined` to track only changes without explicit origins, matching Yjs behavior.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a24858c: Initial public release of valtio-y - collaborative state management for real-time applications. Two-way sync between Valtio proxies and Yjs CRDTs with zero API overhead. Write normal JavaScript, get real-time collaboration free. 👋
