# Realtime Sticky Notes

A minimal demo that shows collaborative sticky notes powered by valtio-y and Cloudflare Durable Objects.

## Scripts

```bash
# Run the local dev experience (Vite + worker)
bun run dev

# Deploy to your Cloudflare account
bun run deploy
```

That’s it—you get real-time sticky notes in dev, and the same experience once deployed.
